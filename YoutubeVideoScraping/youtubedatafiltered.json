This is their YC application video from 2014.\n\nWhen Weave applied to YC, they supplied dentists with an all-in-one customer communications and management system. But their vision was always a larger one. Today, the company still supports dental offices, but also optometrists, vets, and other medical offices with similar capabilities. Tens of thousands of professional offices around the United States and Canada run their businesses using Weave.\n\nRead about their journey at https://blog.ycombinator.com/weave-w14-is-going-public/.",

    "description": "Y Combinator (YC) is arguably the most prestigious and credible startup accelerator globally. Based in Silicon Valley, it's been a critical part of the journey for many of the who's who in the startup world including Stripe, Airbnb, Dropbox, and Reddit.\n\nAs an early stage startup, with a global vision, we (Mys Tyler) would LOVE to be a part of the YC program - with access to some of the best coaching and mentoring, an incredible network, and the stamp of approval that getting into YC affords - we want to change the way people shop, and YC will get us that much closer to realizing our vision. \n\nYC is very competitive, the rumored acceptance rate is 1.5%, so that makes it harder to get into than Stanford. Part of the application process, is a pitch video from the founder/ founding team. This is ours :)",

Please don't take it personally. We carefully reviewed thousands of applications and since there's a limit on the number of startups we can interview in person, we had to turn away a lot of promising companies.\n\nUnfortunately, we can't give you individual feedback about your application. (This page explains why)[http://email.email.ycombinator.com/c/eJwVjcsKwyAURL8mLovvx8JFN_2NcmOuja3RYCwlf18DA3NmGJjFS8mjIskrXJzmOoB1Ep9G48IUi8Faw6mFSdJUOrYC-bZBymT1FBkYCCGyaFFQ4zRqMRsFTqAAbkj2a-_7JO4TfwydoW5zKtBruw0czW89S-0DSPMblC_mT21xUJHj73X9XEvSPex7TgF6quUY8eCU0-EN3xj6H-5cPtI].\n\nWe hope you reapply for the next batch; in fact, we encourage it. The next batch will run from January\u2013March 2021 and the deadline to apply for it is in September 2020. Applying multiple times does not count against you and a surprisingly large number of companies are funded after applying more than once. Over 50% of the startups we accept are repeat applicants.\n\nWe also encourage you to check out Y Combinator\u2019s Startup School. It\u2019s a free online course that keeps you focused on improving your startup. Sign up at startupschool.org.\n\nBest of luck,\n\n\u2014YC",

Our mission is to promote transparent donations of material items to equip nonprofits and communities with the resources necessary to thrive.\u00a0\n\nClosed Captioning (for those with audio impairment)\n\nMy name is Gigi Gillie and I am the co-founder and CEO of Provide Now. I am reporting to you with my co-founder from our separate quarantined spaces. \n\nMy name is Alex Taylor and I am the co-founder and COO of Provide Now \n\nProvide Now creates donations registries for nonprofits. We list material items that local charities need, and donors can purchase items for those nonprofits. \n\nWe are not diverting monetary donations to nonprofits but rather increasing donorship from individuals who are driven by the impact of purchasing an item. So instead of donating $10, you can purchase a bag of dog food and know that 100% of your donation has gone towards feeding a dog. \n\nThe baby boomers are expected to leave $30 trillion in wealth to the younger generations. These younger generations are going to expect a transparent, modern philanthropic experience driven by social media, and we aim to provide that. \n\nAs a donor with Provide Now, you know exactly who you are donating to, what they genuinely need, and where your money is going.",

Before RingCaptcha there was no service for developers and product managers needing a FREE utility to onboard and verify their mobile users with a two step SMS - like most of the big online players have been using for a while (e.g. Whatsapp, Yo, Airbnb). Now they do! ;-) .\n\nOur mission is to help the next Whatsapp apps to oboard and verify their users in a snap of a finger. In the same way like ReCaptcha has done on webspace, let's say that RingCaptcha is Recaptcha for the mobile revolution.\n\nPhone numbers are the ultimate user identity, and we\u2019ve already verified millions of them.\n\nSlideshare: http://www.slideshare.net/500startups/500s-demo-day-batch-13-ringcaptcha\n\nLearn more about 500 Startups here -- http://bit.ly/1hk8saq\n\n-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-\nPlease watch: \"Growing with Pinterest - Pinterest Marketing for Startups\" \n\u27a8 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spjaZRokMVo\n-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-",

Our goal is to collect every price of every product sold in every store, every day. \n\nThe Datasembly CPG Prices product provides access to millions of grocery- and retail-pricing records aggregated from hundreds of grocery delivery and online shopping websites. This data is highly volatile and notoriously difficult to collect but using specialized technology Datasembly aggregates and transforms this data so organizations can use it effectively. These prices currently power economic indicators, market research, and consumer apps.\n\nMany organizations are spending too much time and effort trying to collect data with in-house solutions, but solving this problem requires specialized technology and focus.

We lease, furnish, manage and partner with booking sites like VRBO and Expedia.com to distribute our inventory.\n\nA self-described Opendoor for short-term rental, the company, can furnish homes in just 48hrs and make their property available for bookings. Vacayo is the first company adding new supply to meet the growing vacation rental demand, a $51 billion total addressable market in the US.",

Every App invests in a preferred analytics package (eg Mixpanel, Flurry, Snowplow, Segment.io) with no easy way to improve retention or action insights through marketing automation. Traditional marketing automation platforms take months to rebuild and end up duplicating data.\n\nApps need a faster & better way to engage with their users as most Apps still fail due to:\n1. Poor engagement & retention rates - 77% of users are lost in first 3 days.\n2. Inability to track LTV users & leverage them to get more like them through referrals\n3. Woefully slow iteration to solve these problems.\n\nStreetHawk solves this. By connecting to existing popular mobile analytics we give every App access to marketing automation with no SDK. Apps get immediate insights from their existing analytics & access to an automation engine to drive growth.\n\nSee their deck at: http://www.slideshare.net/500startups/500s-demo-day-batch-14-streethawk\n\nLearn more about 500 Startups here -- http://bit.ly/1hk8saq",

    "description": "Hi my name is Nicole Glaros and I'm the\nmanaging director for TechStars here in Boulder\nand welcome to another edition of TechStars U.\nToday we're going to talk about elevator pitches\nnow elevator pitches are fundamental building block\nto communicating the value of your startup\nbut so many entrepreneurs suck at it\nas soon as you start giving your elevator pitch\nwhat most people hear is\nbla bla bla bla startup\nbla bla bla bla social media platform\nbla bla bla bla API\nthey're just not listening because\nentrepreneurs have not figured out how to effectively communicate their elevator pitch\nso today we're gonna give you a really quick summary of how to do this effectively\nso first of all what is an elevator pitch?\n.\nit's a twenty to thirty second summary of your business in one to two sentences\nand the goal of an elevator pitch is to effectively communicate what it is that you do\nand also get engagement from your audience\nso you are trying to get questions asked back\nso let's talk about the framework for your elevator pitch\nso the framework is\nfor customers with [problem x] we [what you do]\nso let me say that again\nfor customers with [problem x] we [what you do]\nso let's use a couple examples\nRent Monitor is a company from 2010 TechStars class\nnow if we use this framework their elevator pitch would look something like this:\nfor landlords who are overcome with the burden of managing rental properties\nRent Monitor provides a web service platform\nthat allows the automation of many commonly occurring manual tasks\nsuch as rent collection and maintenance requests\nlet's use a second example\nsomething that's near and dear to all of our hearts\nTechStars\nso if TechStars used this framework for their elevator pitch it would sound something like this\nStartups fail 95% of the time.\nTechStars provides capital and mentorship in a 13 week boot camp that will turn that 95% failure rate into a 92% success rate\nnow notice in both of those examples I did not use what we are I always use what we do\nand the reason for that is simple because\nmany people don't understand the lingo of today's technology\nso for TechStars we are a seed accelerator\nbut I never use that in our elevator pitch, why?\nbecause if you don't know what a seed accelerator is\nyou might think hey, cool they grow seeds\nso always talk about what you do, not what you are\nso now that you have the framework down, what you need to do is\nwrite down five to ten versions of your elevator pitch\nand then practice against a real audience\nmake sure you're getting feedback from them\nlisten to the questions that people ask\nand iterate on this framework until you've got a really solid pitch\nonce the pitch is solid you wanna\npractice practice practice\nuntil everybody on your team can say it consistently 100% of the time\neverybody should have it memorized wordforword\nonce you have that done then you want to start paying attention to people's questions\nso questions are going to be indicative of how well they understand what you're talking about and\nyou wanna practice those answers because clearly\na short succinct answer to a question indicates how well you know your product and your market so in summary\nyour elevator pitch should be one to two sentences no more than thirty seconds max\nyou want to iterate until solid\npractice until consistent\nand then practice your answers\nand that will give you a very solid elevator pitch\nthis is Nicole Glaros from TechStars signing off\nthanks for attending TechStars U.\n.\nsource: youtu.be/4FB8-KiYFqQ",
