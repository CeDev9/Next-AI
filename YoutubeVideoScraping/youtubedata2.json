This is their YC application video from 2014.\n\nWhen Weave applied to YC, they supplied dentists with an all-in-one customer communications and management system. But their vision was always a larger one. Today, the company still supports dental offices, but also optometrists, vets, and other medical offices with similar capabilities. Tens of thousands of professional offices around the United States and Canada run their businesses using Weave.\n\nRead about their journey at https://blog.ycombinator.com/weave-w14-is-going-public/.",

We were earliest investors in billion dollar startups like Coinbase and Instacart. I'm doing my own run-and-gun one man YouTube channel with no staff or crew - we're going for raw and unfiltered and high signal in order to help you with your building your world-changing startup.\n\nIn this episode I want to talk about what advice I always give to people writing their YC applications. Watch to the end you'll find a link to submit your YC app to me for comments and review. I can guarantee I'll read the first 100 responses from YouTube, but honestly I'll try my best overall just because I really want to help. \n\nY Combinator changed my life and I hope it changes yours. \n\nPlease like this video and subscribe to my channel if you want to see more videos like this!\n\nFind Garry on Twitter at https://twitter.com/garrytan\n\nLearn more about the companies we fund, and how we work with them at https://initialized.com",

    "description": "Y Combinator (YC) is arguably the most prestigious and credible startup accelerator globally. Based in Silicon Valley, it's been a critical part of the journey for many of the who's who in the startup world including Stripe, Airbnb, Dropbox, and Reddit.\n\nAs an early stage startup, with a global vision, we (Mys Tyler) would LOVE to be a part of the YC program - with access to some of the best coaching and mentoring, an incredible network, and the stamp of approval that getting into YC affords - we want to change the way people shop, and YC will get us that much closer to realizing our vision. \n\nYC is very competitive, the rumored acceptance rate is 1.5%, so that makes it harder to get into than Stanford. Part of the application process, is a pitch video from the founder/ founding team. This is ours :)",

Please don't take it personally. We carefully reviewed thousands of applications and since there's a limit on the number of startups we can interview in person, we had to turn away a lot of promising companies.\n\nUnfortunately, we can't give you individual feedback about your application. (This page explains why)[http://email.email.ycombinator.com/c/eJwVjcsKwyAURL8mLovvx8JFN_2NcmOuja3RYCwlf18DA3NmGJjFS8mjIskrXJzmOoB1Ep9G48IUi8Faw6mFSdJUOrYC-bZBymT1FBkYCCGyaFFQ4zRqMRsFTqAAbkj2a-_7JO4TfwydoW5zKtBruw0czW89S-0DSPMblC_mT21xUJHj73X9XEvSPex7TgF6quUY8eCU0-EN3xj6H-5cPtI].\n\nWe hope you reapply for the next batch; in fact, we encourage it. The next batch will run from January\u2013March 2021 and the deadline to apply for it is in September 2020. Applying multiple times does not count against you and a surprisingly large number of companies are funded after applying more than once. Over 50% of the startups we accept are repeat applicants.\n\nWe also encourage you to check out Y Combinator\u2019s Startup School. It\u2019s a free online course that keeps you focused on improving your startup. Sign up at startupschool.org.\n\nBest of luck,\n\n\u2014YC",

I am reporting to you with my co-founder from our separate quarantined spaces. \n\nMy name is Alex Taylor and I am the co-founder and COO of Provide Now \n\nProvide Now creates donations registries for nonprofits. We list material items that local charities need, and donors can purchase items for those nonprofits. \n\nWe are not diverting monetary donations to nonprofits but rather increasing donorship from individuals who are driven by the impact of purchasing an item. So instead of donating $10, you can purchase a bag of dog food and know that 100% of your donation has gone towards feeding a dog. \n\nThe baby boomers are expected to leave $30 trillion in wealth to the younger generations. These younger generations are going to expect a transparent, modern philanthropic experience driven by social media, and we aim to provide that. \n\nAs a donor with Provide Now, you know exactly who you are donating to, what they genuinely need, and where your money is going.",

    "description": "In this video I share my first-hand experience interviewing with the most famous startup accelerator in the world \u2013 Y Combinator. I address my learnings from being rejected by Y Combinator and being denied $150,000.\nWhat is Y Combinator?\n\nYC provides seed funding for startups. This accelerator program is based in the heart of innovative tech, Silicon Valley. YC has been used to launch companies such as: Stripe, Airbnb, DoorDash, Coinbase, Instacart, Dropbox and Twitch, Cruise Automation, and many more. Once accepted into the program, not only do you get money for your business idea, but you also gain the support of YC partners and the YC community. Founders participate in bi-weekly office hours, and have weekly talks from VCs, prominent founders, and executives.\n\nSome of the current YC partners include:\nMichael Seibel - cofounder of Twitch\nEric Migicovsky -founder of Pebble\nGustaf Alstromer \u2013 growth product lead at Airbnb\nPaul Buchheit \u2013 creator of Gmail\n\nMy partner and I had a new business idea; one that would provide a platform to help creators from YouTube, Instagram, other influencers and teachers monetize their live content.\n\nThis is what the Y Combinator application looks like https://apply.ycombinator.com/app/edit\n\nI've broken down the YC application and YC interview process as follows:\nThe idea: the application will make you think about your idea in terms of\nWhy did you choose this particular idea?\nHow do you plan to grow your business?\nHow do you plan on increasing user acquisition?\nHow do you plan on making money?\nHow does this product differ from what the competition is doing?\n\nGoing over who is all collaborating on this project\nThe team members -- leadership, management, key players\n\nHow invested will you be on working on this project? Is it a side hustle or will you prioritize this venture as your focus and main source of income?\n\nKeep in mind that during this process over 15,000 applications were submitted and only 500 were selected to interview.\n\nThe interview lead was by Michael Seibel (cofounder of Twitch and now board member of Reddit)\nBefore the interview I did not know who would be interviewing us, all I did know was that it would be 3-4 YC partners.Try to stand out in the interview, but don't stress. The interview was very conversational rather than a straight questionnaire -- the whole situation felt very relaxing in an unconventional way.\n\nThat same day I got an email from Michael Seibel asking about the timing of a prototype. \n\nThe 25-minute call with Michael\nWe discussed how we emphasized marketing too heavily and how we should focus more on getting the technical prototype\n\nThe rejection\n2 days after our call, we received the infamous Y Combinator rejection letter which included feedback on why we didn't get in\nAlthough it was a cool product, we were not the right founders for it\n\nThe main lessons learned\nKnow your product\nKnow your customer\nKnow your angle and how that differs from your competitors\nYou need to live and breathe your product or service\nYou need to obsessively think about it\nWork on it, test it, improve it -- night and day\n \nI'm grateful for YC and Michael Seibel taking a chance on interviewing us. If you are on a startup journey yourself, don't give up, believe in yourself and your ideas. Do not be afraid to apply to startup funding programs like Y Combinator!\n\nThis is the first video of a series intended to act as a guide to help you entrepreneurs, small business owners, or anyone interested in businesses learn about what it takes to get funding for your incredible ideas.\nIf you have any further questions regarding the YC application and interview process go ahead and leave it in the comment box and I'll make sure to answer your questions as best I can!\n\nDon't forget to like and subscribe if you haven't already and click the notification bell to alert you when I post more entrepreneurial videos in the future.\n\nStay tuned for more content related to entrepreneurship, motivation, business, real estate investing, startup, seed funding, crowdfunding, personal education, online education, self-improvement, tech. \n\n\u25ba Sign up for algoexpert for practicing coding interview problems:\nhttp://algoexpert.io/luba\nUse code \"luba\" for a 30% discount, it's ending soon!\n\n\u25b6 Subscribe for more awesome videos! http://bit.ly/LifeofLuba\n\n\u25b6 MY YOUTUBE GEAR:\nMain camera - https://amzn.to/2IoCueI\nSecond camera - https://amzn.to/2SapWMy\nMicrophone - https://amzn.to/2CQXsO6\nSound recorder - https://amzn.to/2MDTYDc\nIndoor Lights - https://amzn.to/2B7Eu5M\n\n\u25b6 MY COMPUTER SETUP:\nMacbook Pro - https://amzn.to/2Bc1xMR\n\n\u25b6 FOLLOW ME ON:\n\u2605 INSTAGRAM \u2192 https://www.instagram.com/lifeoflubaa/",

    "description": "Humans are the only species capable of telling stories. These mythologies, religious texts, literature, and histories have formed value and behavior systems throughout civilization. \n\nWe believe that multi-narrative, representational, ideologically-balanced stories can build trust and understanding between groups caught in intractable conflict. \n\nWelcome to Olive Branch Pictures\n\nA production studio for cultural diplomacy, entertainment-education, and philanthropy through  comics and animated movies developed by a talented team and advisory board selected for representation and ideological balance. \n\nOur first production addresses the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict with Shira and Amal: The story of two young women, one Israeli, one Palestinian, who use music to cope with trauma and bring peace to Jerusalem.\n\nOur mission is to improve conditions for long-term positive negotiations and policy change as well as build professional and institutional relationships across the ideological spectrum\n\nOver the next 12 months, we will develop Shira and Amal as a graphic novel capable of sensitively navigating the controversies of the conflict to reach diverse stakeholders and then scale our IP into an Animated Musical Feature Film over the following three years and establish a sustainable animation studio to mediate other conflicts. \n\nSince incorporating in October 2018 we\u2019ve established strategic partnerships, a representational team including Khaled Abousheikh from Gaza, Noa Bendahan from Tel Aviv, and Bashar Bakri from East Jerusalem, and advisors including the former South African Ambassador to the Palestinian Authority Raf Gangat, and Palestinian Sesame Street Creator Daoud Kuttab, we\u2019ve developed the prototype and a 56-page Theory of Change, won competitions at Brandeis and Drexel University, and EO GSEA Connecticut, completed the Watson Institute Accelerator, raised over 15 thousand dollars, interviewed over 100 potential customers and stakeholders, and we are currently part of the 50:50 Startups Incubator which brings Israelis and Palestinians together to build equally-owned startups  \n\nOlive Branch Pictures uses a hybrid B-Corp model with a 501c3 Wing donating 10-20% of profit to diverse regional Non-profit partners decided by our customers, engaging them in the peacebuilding process.\n\nWe will apply best practices in impact measurement under organizations such as the Palestinian Center for Policy & Survey Research and Harmony Labs. \n\nOur goal is to reach at least 2M customers and 2 million stakeholders with the graphic novel which would be subsidized or donation-based in target dialect versions.",

These great events are not getting the audience they deserve.\n\nEvent sites like Sosh, YPlan, and Meetup all run into three main problems: Data, Scalability, and Curation.\n\nHugecity has solved all of these problems by using the 16 million events created on Facebook each month. Facebook is the first place anyone creates an evzSyent because it is the easiest way to share an event. It is up to date because the event managers are directly managing the information for the event. Data is not a problem.\n\nOn May 10th we launched our app, website and email that allows anyone in any city in the world to discover what is happening around them and where their friends are going. We have hundreds of events in every city in the world every day. We have quickly grown to 150,000 monthly visitors and we are still going. Scalability is not a problem. \n\nEveryone's Hugecity is different because we tailor the events we show to each user using their Facebook friends and likes. A user never has to ask their friends to join or tell us what they like. Curation is not a problem. \n\nWe are a team of 4 and we have built a global curated event discovery engine that has solved all three problems that every event site has run into before.\n\nSo, lets talk money. The event promotion industry is worth $24B in the US. In the past few weeks we have manually sold $1000 worth of event promotions to 15 customers. \n\nWe want to come to 500 Startups to automate our sales and grow to launch Hugecity into a viable business.",

In her copious spare time, Edith curates a mobile newsletter.\n\nTranscript:\n\nHow do I submit a successful application to 500 startups?\n\nWe have written many many posts I highly encourage you guys to go to our blog for specific advice. I think in general, we don't really purely fund an idea. Because I focus on mobile, we usually don\u2019t invest in things if you haven\u2019t launched and I'm really hoping that in your application you\u2019ll be able to speak more on metrics. Everybody talks about tractions but particularly with mobile if you\u2019re mobile app, B2C focused. Definitely put down what\u2019s your install, what's your monthly active users, what's your daily active users. I wanna know a founder who keeps track of that and should be especially for early-stage where you measure for success and growth. \n\nAlso, I think in general, most investors are lazy. They want to know how much do you know the market landscape of what you are working on. So it\u2019s not purely talking about yourself, but be able to articulate it. Ok, we know that this one, two, three companies are working on this, but this is what set us apart, this is what differentiates us and why. The way you article it, how you describe some of these metrics and where's your place in the world will set you apart in your application.\n\nLearn more at http://siliconvalleyforum.com/startupedia/funding",

Most of the app developers I know can launch apps over a weekend and just wait for approval. If you\u2019re a B2B focused on business, we would like to see at least two or three pilot customers, because usually takes much longer circles and it\u2019s even harder for us to invest in that enterprise-focused things. But having said that, still, I don't want to discourage you but at least do something, do some customer development first before you apply. So I wouldn't say like if you pure idea stage probably not but after lunch and when before you raise your first round. We\u2019re very open would love to have you apply because going through that process at least you know what we ask even if you don't get accepted that process is really valuable. We\u2019re very open to chat with you and to give you guys advise.\n\nLearn more at http://siliconvalleyforum.com/startupedia/funding",

So the Kollecto experience is like walking into your own personal art gallery, talilored to your taste.\n\nKollecto introduces PERSONALIZATION into the art-world. \n\nRecommendation services have changed the way we find movies, music, and restaurants, but the art-buying process still requires you to comb through millions of options. Kollecto tackles this by grouping people with similar taste profile data & leveraging human Art Advisors to execute Art Advisory at scale.\n\nThe team includes Tara Reed (CEO) who has experience at Foursquare, Google & Microsoft and Emily Havens (Chief Art Advisor) who has 10 years experience advising large institutions and collectors. Kollecto is advised by Gary Chou (Union Square Ventures/ VFA) and Christine Tsai (500 Startups).\n\nSlideshare: http://www.slideshare.net/500startups/500s-demo-day-batch-13-kollecto\n\nLearn more about 500 Startups here -- http://bit.ly/1hk8saq\n\n-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-\nPlease watch: \"Growing with Pinterest - Pinterest Marketing for Startups\" \n\u27a8 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spjaZRokMVo\n-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-",

Before RingCaptcha there was no service for developers and product managers needing a FREE utility to onboard and verify their mobile users with a two step SMS - like most of the big online players have been using for a while (e.g. Whatsapp, Yo, Airbnb). Now they do! ;-) .\n\nOur mission is to help the next Whatsapp apps to oboard and verify their users in a snap of a finger. In the same way like ReCaptcha has done on webspace, let's say that RingCaptcha is Recaptcha for the mobile revolution.\n\nPhone numbers are the ultimate user identity, and we\u2019ve already verified millions of them.\n\nSlideshare: http://www.slideshare.net/500startups/500s-demo-day-batch-13-ringcaptcha\n\nLearn more about 500 Startups here -- http://bit.ly/1hk8saq\n\n-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-\nPlease watch: \"Growing with Pinterest - Pinterest Marketing for Startups\" \n\u27a8 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spjaZRokMVo\n-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-",

Our goal is to collect every price of every product sold in every store, every day. \n\nThe Datasembly CPG Prices product provides access to millions of grocery- and retail-pricing records aggregated from hundreds of grocery delivery and online shopping websites. This data is highly volatile and notoriously difficult to collect but using specialized technology Datasembly aggregates and transforms this data so organizations can use it effectively. These prices currently power economic indicators, market research, and consumer apps.\n\nMany organizations are spending too much time and effort trying to collect data with in-house solutions, but solving this problem requires specialized technology and focus. Datasembly's data-as-a-service model enables companies to focus on extracting and capitalizing on insight from the data they need.\n\nSee their deck at: http://www.slideshare.net/500startups/500s-demo-day-batch-14-datasembly\n\nLearn more about 500 Startups here -- http://bit.ly/1hk8saq",

Vacayo is bringing these properties online so landlords can benefit from the booming cottage industry. Our focus is adding supply to the market while servicing the growing group travel segment. We lease, furnish, manage and partner with booking sites like VRBO and Expedia.com to distribute our inventory.\n\nA self-described Opendoor for short-term rental, the company, can furnish homes in just 48hrs and make their property available for bookings. Vacayo is the first company adding new supply to meet the growing vacation rental demand, a $51 billion total addressable market in the US.",

Every App invests in a preferred analytics package (eg Mixpanel, Flurry, Snowplow, Segment.io) with no easy way to improve retention or action insights through marketing automation. Traditional marketing automation platforms take months to rebuild and end up duplicating data.\n\nApps need a faster & better way to engage with their users as most Apps still fail due to:\n1. Poor engagement & retention rates - 77% of users are lost in first 3 days.\n2. Inability to track LTV users & leverage them to get more like them through referrals\n3. Woefully slow iteration to solve these problems.\n\nStreetHawk solves this. By connecting to existing popular mobile analytics we give every App access to marketing automation with no SDK. Apps get immediate insights from their existing analytics & access to an automation engine to drive growth.\n\nSee their deck at: http://www.slideshare.net/500startups/500s-demo-day-batch-14-streethawk\n\nLearn more about 500 Startups here -- http://bit.ly/1hk8saq",

Paired with the Numa M mobile app, it is a comprehensive monitoring and security solution for every device from fridge to phone.\n\nNuma isn't just a firewall - it's much more than that. Where firewalls just look at the envelope, Numa takes an x-ray. Numa M isn't just a way to see what's going on with your network, it protects your phone wherever you go, without draining your battery.\n\nNuma stops attacks that antivirus software can't. It keeps malicious traffic from getting in in the first place, so it protects connected devices such as thermostats, refrigerators, IP cameras, and control systems.\n\nNuma is security for the next generation of Internet applications. Our devices are getting smarter. Shouldn't our networks, too?\n\nSlideshare: http://www.slideshare.net/500startups/500s-demo-day-batch-13-nodal\n\nLearn more about 500 Startups here -- http://bit.ly/1hk8saq\n\n-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-\nPlease watch: \"Growing with Pinterest - Pinterest Marketing for Startups\" \n\u27a8 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spjaZRokMVo\n-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-",

Founded with a mission to inspire the next generation of environmental stewards, Junior Explorers teaches kids about wildlife and nature in a fun and engaging way. A social enterprise, the company fulfills its social mission by donating back a percentage of its profits to conservation. \n\nEach month, Junior Explorers go on exciting missions to explore different ecosystems, such as the Arctic in search of a missing polar bear, the Serengeti to observe the great migration, or to explore the Amazon. Every mission starts at home with a kit arriving in the mail that includes collectibles, activities, and information about that month's mission. Kids then go online and complete their mission through a rich gamified learning experience that's accessible on computers and mobile devices.\n\nSee their deck at: http://www.slideshare.net/500startups/500s-demo-day-batch-14-junior-explorers-inc\n\nLearn more about 500 Startups here -- http://bit.ly/1hk8saq",
