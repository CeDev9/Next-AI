Hello, everyone. First of all, we will like to thank you for your interest in our research in this paper. We try to understand how human interaction features such as facial expressions vocal emotions and word choices might influence economic agents decision making in order to study this question empirically, we build an empirical approach that uses videos of human interactions as data input and and machine learning based algorithms as the tool. We apply an empirical approach in a setting where early stage Turn up Pitch Venture capitalists for early-stage funding. We find that pitch features along visual vocal and verbal damages all matter for the probability of receiving funding and we also show that this event impact is largely due to interaction induced biases rather than that interactions provide additional valuable information the empirical structure that you see in this code example can hopefully help you to get started with using video in other important settings such as As interviews classroom recordings among many other exciting things. We look forward to hearing your feedback and reading about your research. Thank you.
